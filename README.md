# README

This is the back-end repository for the Shrinelords application, created collaboratively with @yapjinai. It houses several videos for the shrine backgrounds (included in the src/public folder) as well as a full API of offerings to be seeded (items that can be added to the shrines).

API requests should be sent to this through the application front-end found at: https://github.com/yapjinai/shrinelords-frontend
