# README

This is the back-end repository for the Shrinelords application, created collaboratively with @yapjinai. It houses the back-end structure for the application along with the seeds for the Offering models, which are to be used in shrine editing from the front-end.

API requests should be sent to this through the application front-end found at: https://github.com/yapjinai/shrinelords-frontend
